# noita-twitch-wands-overlay
Twitch overlay extension that shows a streamer's wands in realtime. Hooks into onlywands.com 

# How to use
For now, the extension is in an alpha state. In order to install it on your stream, I (@halfbro) need to manually add you to the list of users with access to test the extension on Twitch.

In addition, this extension currently relies on the [streamer-wands](https://github.com/soler91/streamer-wands) project. You'll need to install and configure that mod in Noita.

You also need to be approved in order to use it on a stream enabled for testing. When released it will be available to anyone watching the stream.
